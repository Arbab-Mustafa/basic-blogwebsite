        <h2>What Is Natural Language Processing?</h2>
        <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction
          between computers and human language. It involves enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate
          human language in a meaningful way.</p>

        <h3>Key NLP Techniques</h3>
        <p>Some of the key techniques in NLP include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tokenization:</strong> The process of breaking down text into smaller units, such as words or
            phrases.</li>
          <li><strong>Part-of-Speech Tagging:</strong> Identifying the grammatical role of each word in a sentence.</li>
          <li><strong>Named Entity Recognition (NER):</strong> Identifying and classifying entities such as names,
            dates, and locations in text.</li>
          <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> Determining the sentiment or emotional tone of a piece of text.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Applications of NLP</h3>
        <p>NLP has a wide range of applications, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Chatbots:</strong> Providing automated responses and customer support.</li>
          <li><strong>Translation:</strong> Translating text between different languages.</li>
          <li><strong>Text Summarization:</strong> Creating concise summaries of longer texts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Challenges in NLP</h3>
        <p>Despite its advancements, NLP still faces several challenges, such as understanding context, handling
          ambiguous language, and dealing with different languages and dialects.</p>

        <p>NLP is a rapidly evolving field with ongoing research aimed at improving the accuracy and capabilities of
          language processing systems. It plays a crucial role in making human-computer interactions more natural and
          effective.</p>
