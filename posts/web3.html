        <h2>What Is Web 3.0?</h2>
        <p>Web 3.0 represents the next generation of the internet, focusing on decentralization, blockchain technology,
          and user empowerment. Unlike Web 2.0, which is centered around centralized platforms, Web 3.0 aims to give
          users more control over their data and online interactions.</p>

        <h3>Decentralization</h3>
        <p>Decentralization is a core principle of Web 3.0. It involves distributing control away from central
          authorities and allowing peer-to-peer interactions. Blockchain technology underpins this decentralization by
          providing a transparent and immutable ledger.</p>

          alt="Decentralization">

        <h3>Blockchain Technology</h3>
        <p>Blockchain is the backbone of Web 3.0. It is a distributed ledger technology that ensures data integrity and
          transparency. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum use blockchain to facilitate secure transactions.</p>

        <h3>Smart Contracts</h3>
        <p>Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They
          automate and enforce contractual agreements without intermediaries.</p>

        <h3>Decentralized Applications (dApps)</h3>
        <p>dApps are applications that run on a decentralized network. Unlike traditional apps, dApps operate on
          blockchain and are not controlled by a single entity. They offer greater transparency and security.</p>

        <h3>Impact and Future</h3>
        <p>Web 3.0 has the potential to transform various sectors, including finance, social media, and supply chain
          management. It promises increased privacy, data ownership, and a more equitable online ecosystem.</p>

        <p>The transition to Web 3.0 is still in its early stages, but it is expected to drive significant changes in
          how we interact with the internet and digital technologies.</p>
