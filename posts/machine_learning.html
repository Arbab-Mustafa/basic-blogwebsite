        <h2>What Is Machine Learning?</h2>
        <p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms that allow
          computers to learn and make predictions from data. It involves training models to recognize patterns and make
          decisions without explicit programming.</p>

        <h3>Types of Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>Machine learning can be categorized into three main types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> The model is trained on labeled data, learning to predict outcomes
            based on input features.</li>
          <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> The model is trained on unlabeled data and aims to find hidden
            patterns or groupings.</li>
          <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> The model learns through interactions with an environment,
            receiving rewards or penalties for actions taken.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Popular Algorithms</h3>
        <p>Some popular machine learning algorithms include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Linear Regression:</strong> Used for predicting continuous values.</li>
          <li><strong>Decision Trees:</strong> Used for classification and regression tasks.</li>
          <li><strong>Neural Networks:</strong> Inspired by the human brain, used for complex pattern recognition.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Applications of Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>Machine learning has a wide range of applications, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Predicting patient outcomes, diagnosing diseases, and personalizing
            treatments.</li>
          <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and risk assessment.</li>
          <li><strong>Retail:</strong> Customer segmentation, recommendation systems, and inventory management.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Getting started with machine learning involves understanding these fundamental concepts, experimenting with
          algorithms, and applying them to real-world problems. It's a field with endless possibilities and significant
          impact on various industries.</p>
