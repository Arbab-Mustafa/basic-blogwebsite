        <h2>What Is Data Science?</h2>
        <p>Data science combines statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization to extract insights from
          data. It involves collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data to support decision-making processes.</p>

        <h3>Data Collection</h3>
        <p>Data collection is the first step in data science. It involves gathering data from various sources such as
          databases, APIs, and web scraping.</p>

        <h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
        <p>Data cleaning involves preprocessing and transforming raw data to make it suitable for analysis. This step
          includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors.</p>

        <h3>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
        <p>EDA involves summarizing and visualizing data to understand its structure and patterns. It helps identify
          trends, correlations, and outliers.</p>

        <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>Machine learning is a subset of data science that involves building models to make predictions or decisions
          based on data. Techniques include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.</p>

        <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
        <p>Data visualization involves creating charts, graphs, and dashboards to communicate insights effectively.
          Tools like Tableau and Power BI are commonly used for this purpose.</p>

        <p>Data science is a rapidly growing field with applications in various industries, including finance,
          healthcare, and marketing. It plays a crucial role in leveraging data to drive business success.</p>
